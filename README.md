** AirBox - an attachment for a Kelly Kettle which turns it into an AirFryer


This repo contains a few OpenSCAD concept models for a device I thought would be interesting to attach to a Kelly Kettle, turning it into a self-regulating "hot air box" oven with features similar to an Air-Fryer: contained constant-temperature fire flow suitable for cooking.

*** Why?

Well, just as a thought experiment, really.  The Kelly Kettle is a perfectly functional cooking device as it is, you just need the correct pan/pot/container setup for it, and you can attain results which even exceed those of your average kitchen AirFryer device.

However, the thought experiment is more "How can the Kelly Kettle be used as an energy source for other things?", and the desire to have a wood-fired, regulated-temperature air box is also cognizant of the fact that flow ovens are handy for repairing electronics, too

So, there will be more of that thought experimenting and less of the "is this really practical?" kind of thing going on in this repo.

*** TODO:

	1. Basic OpenSCAD models: [x]
	2. Simulation
	3. Parameterization
	4. ML techniques

*** Materials:

	-- 3D-printed ceramics would be nice.
	-- Models targetting flat sheet steel (easy to human-manufacture) should also be demonstrated.
